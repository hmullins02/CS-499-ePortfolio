Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of OpenGL and GLSL shaders to render a 3D scene featuring a rotating pyramid and cube with continuously changing color gradients. The code is written in C++ and uses the GLFW library for window management and GLEW for handling OpenGL extensions.

Prerequisites

Before compiling and running the code, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- A C++ compiler (Visual Studio 2022 is what I used)
- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLEW
- GLM (OpenGL Mathematics library)

Running the project


-	Create a Visal Studio project named Category 2 Enhancement - 3D Pyramid and Cube.
-	Inside the project folder, the provided Debug and OpenGLSample folders within this repository branch should be used. Replace the Debug folder that's in there if there is one.
-	If there is a .sln file, replace it with the OpenGLSample.sln provided in this repository.
-	Ensure the solution platform is set to x86
 
-	Click the “Start without Debugging” button to build and run the code. Pictures labeled "Display1" and "Display2" are examples of what will be shown on a successfuly run.
