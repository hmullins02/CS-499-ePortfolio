## Professional Self-Assessment

## Introduction
Completing my coursework and developing my ePortfolio has profoundly impacted my readiness to enter the computer science field. This journey has allowed me to showcase my strengths, refine my professional goals and values, and build a skill set that makes me an attractive candidate for various roles in the industry. By engaging with complex projects and real-world scenarios, I have honed my abilities in several critical areas, including collaboration, communication, data structures, algorithms, software engineering, database management, and security. <br>

## Collaborating in a Team Environment
Working in team environments has been a cornerstone of my development. For instance, during a software engineering course specializing in SDLC, I collaborated with peers to develop comprehensive project management tools. I also use this methodology daily as a Manufacturing Engineer Technician. There are lots of 8D and Lean Six Sigma projects that require a great amount of team collaboration. These experiences taught me the importance of clear communication, role delegation, and iterative development. We used agile methodologies to ensure that all team members were on the same page and that the project progressed smoothly. <br>

## Communicating with Stakeholders
Effective communication with stakeholders is crucial in any project. Looking outside of my schooling and into my professionaly experience, I am often a stakeholder, and even more often have to win over stakeholders as a manufacturing engineer technician. Recently we implemented a new automated system that many manufacturing operators did not like the idea of. Through effective communication and explanation of the benefits of the new system, there was more interest from the stakeholders in the new system. Fostering good relationships with stakeholders is vital for project success.<br>

## Data Structures and Algorithms
A strong understanding of data structures and algorithms is fundamental to solving computational problems efficiently. Throughout my coursework, I delved deep into these topics, working on numerous assignments and projects that required the application of various data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs, as well as algorithms for searching, sorting, and optimization. One notable project involved developing a pathfinding algorithm for a maze-solving AI, which demonstrated my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems and optimize solutions for performance.<br>

## Software Engineering and Database Management
The principles of software engineering and database management are integral to developing robust and scalable applications. My coursework included extensive training in these areas, from designing software architecture to implementing and maintaining databases. In a project for a client/server course, I designed and implemented a database that utilized a company's database of dogs in an animal shelter. The database included sorting/filtering abilities, map locations of each animal, a visual diagram of different dog breeds, etc. This experience underscored the importance of structured data management and the role of databases in modern software applications.<br>

## Security
My studies covered various aspects of cybersecurity, from understanding common threats and vulnerabilities to implementing security measures in software development. A project in one of my security courses involved performing a security audit on a sample web application, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and recommending mitigation strategies. This hands-on experience highlighted the need for a proactive approach to security and the implementation of best practices to protect systems and data.<br>
