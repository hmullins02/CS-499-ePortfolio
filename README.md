## Demonstrations
Throughout this course I have employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science by providing contextual, in-code comments that result in easily readable and understandable.<br>

I have designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by discussing experiences and best practices in communication and clearly conveying my ideas and explain my thought process through written communication.<br>

I have designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices by programming solutions that solve logic problems and implement them in software. Reaching out to a website with an application may not seem that in depth, but it is a very involved evolution. I had to create a few methods to cover all the functionality needed to complete this step and it is still, in my opinion, an amateur attempt. I have also discussed experiences and best practices in designing and evaluating computing solutions within this narrative for the project.<br> 

I have demonstrated the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by employing iterative testing techniques in the code by using the software development life cycle to create realistic production schedules for software projects, creating industry-standard software designs, discussing experiences and best practices in using well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices.<br> 

I have developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by address potential design flaws in software architecture during the requirements phase (user permissions), eradicating security vulnerabilities or bugs by correcting all errors and addressing all warnings in the IDE, defining an approach that ensures all data are explicitly validated. When creating the “DatabaseHelper” class I demonstrated the ability to consider future changes to objects and classes by making all methods reside in it. Now when adding more activities that want to interface with the database there is a common structure that is designed to manage these methods and keep them all in one place, instead of creating new classes that must be updated whenever a new class is added.
