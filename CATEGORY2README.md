Introduction 

This project demonstrates the use of OpenGL and GLSL shaders to render a 3D scene featuring a rotating pyramid and cube with continuously changing color gradients. The code is written in C++ and uses the GLFW library for window management and GLEW for handling OpenGL extensions.

Prerequisites

Before compiling and running the code, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- A C++ compiler (Visual Studio 2022 is what I used)
- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLEW
- GLM (OpenGL Mathematics library)


Running the project

- Create a new empty C++ Visal Studio project named Category 2 Enhancement - 3D Pyramid and Cube. (For PRE ehancement, a new project should be created named "Static 3D Pyramid")
- Close Visual Studio and navigate to the project folder.
- Inside the project folder, delete the .sln file and generated folder.
- Unzip the "OpenGLSample.zip" provided from this repository. (For PRE ehancement, "OpenGLSamplePRE.zip" should be used)
- Add the unzipped folder to your new project folder.
- Add the OpenGLSample.sln file to your new project folder.
- Click on the OpenGLSample.sln file.
- Ensure the solution platform is set to x86
- From Source.cpp, click the “Start without Debugging” button to build and run the code. Pictures labeled "Display1" and "Display2" are examples of what will be shown on a successfuly run. (For PRE enhancement, see "Display3")
